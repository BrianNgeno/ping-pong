## Known Bugs
There are no unresolved issues in regards to this code that I know of.

# Description
-the project was basically using 
~~~
-css
-js
-html 
~~~
as the primary languages for coding

## Technologies Used
I worked on this code on Linux OS. I used HTML to write the code, CSS and Bootstrap to style and organize it; JavaScript and the jQuery-3.3.1.min library for functionality purposes, and Markdown language on the ABOUTME section. I created the code using Atom and Git applications.


# Installation and Running
The program runs basically on every browser.
In case one is missing a web-browser one should download:
```
-Chrome.
-Mozilla fire Fox.
-Chromium.
```
To be able to run this web application, you will need to have a web browser, preferably Google Chrome. Just open the url link deployed on GitHub and run it.

-on opening the link on a web browser one should sign in and proceed to play the game where they provide the number they need to run and ping-pong it.

## Support and contact details
